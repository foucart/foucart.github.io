For doctoral students interested in a PhD under my guidance, here is a list of research topics that I will supervise. Approximation Theory is a common thread throughout, but specific topics require to know/learn other subjects.  

1. MINIMAL PROJECTIONS
(the most theoretical topic)
subjects: Functional Analysis, Frame Theory
sources: my (upcoming) survey [2], my journal publications [24,32,49]

2. APPROXIMATION THEORY AND SEMIDEFINITE PROGRAMMING
(the most computational topic)
subjects: Numerical Analysis, Software Development
sources: my software BASC, my journal publications [22,54]

3. MODERN OPTIMAL RECOVERY
(the most in-vogue topic)
subjects: Optimization, Data Science  
sources: my journal publications [47,51,52,55]

4. DETERMINISTIC COMPRESSIVE SENSING
(the most explorative topic)
subjects: Derandomization, Combinatorics
sources: my survey [1], my book chapter [12]

To obtain more information, you are welcome to come and talk to me. To start research with me, besides a strong academic record, you will also be expected to have taken at least one of my courses.
