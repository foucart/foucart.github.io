<h2>Principles</h2>

<p>Surveys in Approximation Theory (SAT), as the name suggests, is a solely
WWW-based collection of surveys in the area of approximation theory. These surveys
are offered as a free service to the scientific community.</p>

<p>This collection of surveys in aproximation theory and associated material is
meant for the present and future mathematical community. It is an attempt to
present our subject in an accessible, organized and open fashion. Survey articles
will be regularly solicited. These surveys are directed at the graduate student
level and beyond.</p>

<p>Mathematical writing is ineffective if it is not communicated, and
scholarly enterprise rests on the free exchange of ideas. This collection
will be freely accessible to anyone with an Internet connection. There are
no page charges for authors and no subscription fees for users. In addition,
it is our aim that these articles will be searchable, navigable and
retrievable. To ensure its long-term availability and relevance, it will be
properly archived and updated. To make citing a survey valid over time, its
original version will be available alongside any subsequent versions.</p>

<p>SAT is not meant as a first-publication journal, nor a collection of
electronic monographs or textbooks. Instead, these survey articles are meant
to review a topic while citing, explaining and assessing the most relevant,
important and interesting aspects of the topic. In this manner, it is hoped
that SAT will provide a valuable and unique service to the approximation
theory and mathematical community. Articles may be broad or narrow in scope.
The essential requirements are a well specified topic, together with clear
exposition. </p>

<p>SAT will be organized into yearly volumes. Articles will appear as they
are ready. All articles will be peer reviewed (refereed).  Peer reviewing is
essential in the maintainance of high standards. No attempt will be made
to speed up the refereeing process at the cost of quality.  Authors are
encouraged to use the suggested technical format (template). A degree of
uniformity will permit us to more easily upgrade to newer technologies.</p>
