the author defines the weighted Sobolev space $W^r_{p,g}(\Omega)$, and the
weighted Lebesgue space $L_{q,\nu}(\Omega)$. A review is presented of the cases where one has exact estimates for the
Kolmogorov $n$-widths of the unit ball of  $W^r_{p,g}(\Omega)$ in $L_{q,\nu}(\Omega)$.

In this paper are to be found two examples of order estimates of these Kolmogorov (and linear) $n$-widths
where $\Omega$ is a John domain and the weights $g, \nu$ are functions of distance to some $h$-subset of $\partial \Omega$.
And also where $\Omega = R^d$ and the weights are powers of $1+ |x|$. The exact definitions and theorems are rather
technical in nature.
