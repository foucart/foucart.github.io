<p>First read the full text of our publication release
agreement. Note that we do not ask you to transfer the copyright to us:</p>

       
<p><strong>1. </strong>This is an agreement between Surveys in Approximation
Theory (<em>SAT</em>), and the copyright owner (the <em>Owner</em>) of a
work (the <em>Work</em>) to be published in SAT.</p>
       
<p><strong>2. </strong>The Owner warrants that s/he has the full power and
authority to enter into this agreement and to grant the rights granted in
this agreement.</p>
       
<p><strong>3. </strong>The Owner hereby grants to SAT a worldwide,
irrevocable, royalty free license to publish or distribute the Work, to
enter into arrangements with others to publish or distribute the Work, and
to archive the Work.</p>
 
<p><strong>4. </strong>The Owner agrees that further publication of the
Work, with the same or substantially the same content as appears in SAT,
will include an acknowledgement of prior publication in SAT.</p>

<p>Now, copy the text of the agreement above into an e-mail message to
<a href=mailto:sat@math.technion.ac.il>sat@math.technion.ac.il
</a>. Then add the title of your paper and the names of all
authors, plus the statement "I (We) accept the terms of this agreement". Type
"Publication Release" in the subject line and send the message.</p>

<p>(The above is based on the Publication Release Form of the Electronic
