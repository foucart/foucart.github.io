
Dear -----,

We are writing to invite you to write a survey paper to be included in Surveys
in Approximation Theory (SAT).

SAT, as the name implies, will be a web based collection of surveys in the area
of approximation theory. These surveys are offered as a free service to the
scientific community. We hope that SAT will prove useful for mathematicians in
general and for approximation theorists in particular. It is our aim to present
our subject in an accessible, organized and open and user-friendly fashion.

SAT is not meant as a first-publication journal, nor a collection of
electronic monographs or textbooks. These survey articles are meant to
review specific topics while citing, explaining and assessing the most
relevant, important and interesting aspects of the topic.

We would like to invite you to write a survey paper on a topic of your
choosing. We expect papers to be scholarly -- the author should know the
subject! -- and to be written carefully so as to be comprehensible to some
appropriate target audience (advanced graduate student and beyond).

In other regards we are flexible. The topic might be active current
research or neglected classical material. The length of the article is not
a factor. There may or may not be an attempt to give a historical
perspective. One can write in the style of a textbook chapter (with proofs
of most results) or the conventional style of journal surveys (outlining
proofs of major results).

The essential requirement is that it should be interesting and informative
to someone.

If you are willing to write such a survey, please let us have a tentative
title, a brief description of planned contents (this can be just a list of
phrases, intended only for the Editors use in the unlikely event that two
people choose the same topic), and an estimate of completion date. Please
respond to ?? at ??.

Have a look at our homepage:

We subscribe to the notion that mathematical research and exposition
should be freely available on-line. That should be the 21st century
meaning of the word "publication". This is the motivation for SAT.
