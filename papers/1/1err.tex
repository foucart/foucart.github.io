In Theorem 3.3 (page 8), the right-hand-side of the inequality in Theorem
3.3 should contain a $\max_{y\in [a,b]}$ before the absolute value, i.e., on
the r.h.s.~should be the uniform norm of that function. (It is not true for
all $y\in [a,b]$.)

In the last formula in the text of Theorem 3.4 on the next page the $y$ should
be an $x$.
